--- Day 1 Log ---

1. What did I do today?
- 
I installed a bunch of programs and I have no idea how they work. For the first time used GitHub not just as an observer, but as a user. And lastly throughout all of this I actively used chatGPT to troubleshoot (many times). 
2. What confused or slowed me down?
- 
Everything, but mostly UI of different softwares.
3. What did I complete?
- 
I completed all of the blocks. Happy:)
4. Whatâ€™s my plan for tomorrow?
- 
Continue working for 2 hours. No delay, straight to work. Be a man.
